# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) & APIs

### Date: 9/5/19

### Summary

Today we received an introduction in OOP and how to apply the concept in Python. Its usefulness seems apparent in the RPG/Choose Your Own Adventure type games as you can make the concrete connection between real-world objects and their representation within a Python script.

In the game_of_thrones_starter file, we are simulating calling an API and parsing through the resulting data to answer questions about said data. The work is found in the `got_demo.py`.
